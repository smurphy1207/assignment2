    <h4> GOP candidates increased the percentage of votes won in each of the five boroughs between 2020 and 2024. </h4>

    <p> As the results rolled in on election night, it was clear Donald Trump had become more appealing to voters in democratic strongholds like New York City. Those gains were not just seen at the top of the ticket for Republicans but carried through all 13 congressional districts making up the five boroughs. </p>

    <p> Overall, GOP candidates for Congress improved their percentage of votes won in NYC by 6.5% from 2020 to 2024. That uptick is highlighted by a 14.1% gain in the Bronx, a 12.9% increase in Brooklyn and a 10.6% gain in Manhattan. </p>

    <p> Donald Trump had an overall increase of 8.3% across the city, picking up 11% more votes in the Bronx and Queens on his path to the White House. </p>

    <p> “From a political science perspective, what we've seen over the last few election cycles is the amount of straight-ticket voting is at this kind of historic high,” said Anthony Sparacino, assistant professor of political science at York College. Sparacino suggested that the coordinated increase between GOP congressional candidates and Trump could be due to people deciding to vote for the presidential candidate and filling the rest of their ballot with only Republican candidates. </p>

    <p> Asked if this is a sign for Democrats to be concerned in upcoming national elections, Sparacino believes the right-ward trend may continue, but “I don’t think [New York] will get to purple. It might be a slightly lighter shade of blue, but I still think it’s going to be blue.” </p>
